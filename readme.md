# Laracasts - The PHP Practitioner

### PHP and HTML
Created HTML markup and echoed a sentence onto the page, using the URL parameters from the browser address bar.

### Separate PHP Logic From Presentation
Created a new view file to keep html markup and to have it separate from the PHP data logic.

### Understanding Arrays
Create a list of items and then display them as an unordered list in the view.
